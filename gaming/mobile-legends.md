  to play Dota 2 / CS:GO with moved on to other games. I received an invite to
  play from a workmate and said 'why not?'

# Mobile Legends (My road to Mythic)

Originally, I despised the idea of mobile gaming - what could possibly be so fun about staring at your phone more than you already do browsing the internet and updating your social media? And the fact that it seems so EASY to play compared to my most played game - Dota 2 - makes it childishly unappealing. But I guess the allure of actually having someone to play with instead of going solo all the time helped me make the decision to try it.
Try it, I did, but with a 'modest' goal of achieving the highest rank medal (Mythic) within two months of playing.

The rankings are segregated like this (from lowest to highest): 
- Warrior
- Elite
- Master
- Grandmaster
- Epic
- Legend
- Mythic

As you can see, I would have to go up 6 medals from Warrior with tiers and stars in between to achieve my goal. It's a long road, because in-between medals, there are roman-numbered tiers that you get promoted to when you gain full stars. You normally get 1 star per win. Then once you reach tier I of a medal, filling up the stars of that tier will result in a promotion to the next medal.

### April 23-30  
A week full of highs, I can't seem to stop winning as I leveled up, played rank and achieved Epic rank all within a week. Found a hero I REALLY liked playstyle-wise and aesthetically - Harith. Needless to say, I spent around 1000 php to get this hero immediately and participate in a few in-game top-up (recharge) events. Although at this point, it would be foolish of me to think that my game knowledge is anywhere near enough to achieve my goal. But I felt pretty good and thought I may be able to achieve Mythic in 1 month. Lol.

### May 1-7  
As I started really liking this game, I spent progressively more time exploring events, shop, emblems and achievements. But as if it goes hand in hand with game immersion  -  money spending went up really quick as well. This is the week I spent 1000 php for stuff I can't even remember anymore, and another 5000 php for the team recharge event with guaranteed free skins as long as that 5k gets spent. Didn't really play ranked much as I felt like I had a lot of time to reach mythic in time, so I instead played classic, brawl and made more friends in game.

### May 8-15
I cut short the previous week by 1 day because on May 7, I declared that I will achieve the legend medal in 1 week. Started seriously playing ranked again, which, I should have mentioned, employs draft style picking phase starting at Epic level.  

There are three key differences that make this better competitively than picking phase at lower ranks:  
1. You can ban out stupidly overpowered heroes that you can't play / don't have
2. You can't have two of the same hero on each side anymore (previously your team and enemy team could pick the same hero)
3. You can see the enemy's picks before the game thus you can counter-pick.

A very. Frustrating. Week. The first two days saw my Epic V dropping to Grandmaster I repeatedly, and the worst thing is I have no idea what my mistakes were. My best hero, Harith, and my second best hero, Xborg, can't win consistently and I was understandably furious.

So I spent another 1000 php to buy Hylos, upgrade emblems, and buy skins with the leftover diamonds. Around this time is when I just focused on learning the meta heroes and staying away from ranked for a bit, but alas, nothing still worked when I started playing ranked again. Even when I was adjusting to my team's needs (using tank, mage, or fighter as necessary).  

However, there's this growing feeling of familiarity in my head as I continue playing, which will turn out to be the difference maker. It was experience, and the game knowledge that comes with it. As I get acquainted with more and more heroes, I start to memorize their skills and their playstyles. Huh, they weren't really too hard to play against, I just didn't know better. It was this *eureka* moment that propelled my rank from Epic V to Epic I. Four more stars and I'll have the Legend medal.

### May 16-23
