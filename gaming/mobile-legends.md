  I started playing this game on April 23, 2020 when most of the friends I used
  to play Dota 2 / CS:GO with moved on to other games. I received an invite to
  play from a workmate and said 'why not?'

# Mobile Legends

Originally, I despised the idea of mobile gaming - what could possibly be so fun about staring at your phone more than you already do browsing the internet and updating your social media? And the fact that it seems so EASY to play compared to my most played game - Dota 2 - makes it childishly unappealing. But I guess the allure of actually having someone to play with instead of going solo all the time helped me make the decision to try it. Try it, I did, but with a 'modest' goal of achieving the highest rank medal \(Mythic\) within two months of playing.

For reference, the rankings are segregated like this \(from lowest to highest\):

* Warrior
* Elite
* Master
* Grandmaster
* Epic
* Legend
* Mythic

As you can see, I would have to go up 6 medals from Warrior with tiers and stars in between to achieve my goal. It's a long road, because in-between medals, there are roman-numbered tiers that you get promoted to when you gain full stars, and you normally get only 1 star per win. Once you reach tier I of a medal, filling up the stars of that tier will result in a promotion to the next medal.

## April 23-30

A week full of highs, I can't seem to stop winning as I leveled up, played rank and achieved Epic rank all within a week. Found a hero I REALLY liked playstyle-wise and aesthetically - Harith. Needless to say, I spent around 1000 php to get this hero immediately and participate in a few in-game top-up \(recharge\) events. Although at this point, it would be foolish of me to think that my game knowledge is anywhere near enough to achieve my goal. But I felt pretty good and thought I may be able to achieve Mythic in 1 month. Lol.

## May 1-7

As I started really liking this game, I spent progressively more time exploring events, shop, emblems and achievements. But as if it goes hand in hand with game immersion - money spending went up really quick as well. This is the week I spent 1000 php for stuff I can't even remember anymore, and another 5000 php for the team recharge event with guaranteed free skins as long as that 5k gets spent. Didn't really play ranked much as I felt like I had a lot of time to reach mythic in time, so I instead played classic, brawl and made more friends in game.

## May 8-15

I cut short the previous week by 1 day because on May 7, I declared that I will achieve the legend medal in 1 week. Started seriously playing ranked again, which, I should have mentioned, employs draft style picking phase starting at Epic level.

There are three key differences that make this better competitively than picking phase at lower ranks:  
1. You can ban out stupidly overpowered heroes that you can't play / don't have 2. You can't have two of the same hero on each side anymore \(previously your team and enemy team could pick the same hero\) 3. You can see the enemy's picks before the game thus you can counter-pick.

A very. Frustrating. Week. The first two days saw my Epic V dropping to Grandmaster I repeatedly, and the worst thing is I have no idea what my mistakes were. My best hero, Harith, and my second best hero, Xborg, can't win consistently and I was understandably furious.

So I spent another 1000 php to buy Hylos, upgrade emblems, and buy skins with the leftover diamonds. Around this time is when I just focused on learning the meta heroes and staying away from ranked for a bit, but alas, nothing still worked when I started playing ranked again. Even when I was adjusting to my team's needs \(using tank, mage, or fighter as necessary\).

However, there's this growing feeling of familiarity in my head as I continue playing, which will turn out to be the difference maker. It was experience, and the game knowledge that comes with it. As I get acquainted with more and more heroes, I start to memorize their skills and their playstyles. Huh, they weren't really too hard to play against, I just didn't know better. It was this _eureka_ moment that propelled my rank from Epic V to Epic I. Four more stars and I'll have the Legend medal.

## May 16-21

I hated the start of this week. One more star until Mythic and I had the fucking idea to win no matter what using my favorite \(out of meta\) hero - Harith. And just like clockwork, I kept losing until I'm dropped back in Epic II. What a bummer. I took a day of rest, teamed up with some friends, messed around, and reached Legend before I knew it on May 21.

## May 22-24

What is essentially 31 days since I first played Mobile Legends \(and 2 days since I reached Legend\), I achieved the coveted Mythic medal. Calibration was hell as I lost 9 games \(never played solo, all 10 games were with pre-made team of newbies like me\) so I ended up with just 40 points after. 

## May 25-June 1

Goddamn, you wouldn't believe how vast the difference in skill is between Legend and Mythic, and how tryhard the players in this tier are.

They will pick counters, ACTUALLY BAN TANKS which hurt my 2-hero-pool-both-tanks ass, and rotate crazy quick for a team of randoms. These gamers are no joke and you could tell they have lots experience. Here, you'll encounter some with cool ideas that you'd want to try yourself, some who are literal gods can solo carry the game using specific heroes, and some who are like me - knows enough of MOBA to play at the somewhat high level but without the game-specific knowledge needed to cross over the mastery line. Over the course of 1 week I dropped to Legend I a total of THREE times trying to learn new heroes and adapt to the smarter drafting stage. I learned Valir, Diggie, Atlas, Grock, Cecilion with enough confidence to use them in Ranked.

This week might just be the period aside from my first week where I learned the most. I started seeing beyond missed skillshots and incorrect skill usage to where the missed timings, dynamic itemizations, and proper rotations come in play. I still don't know the skills of several heroes as I prefer to learn by playing against / with them and feeling for myself, so with that in mind, I know that this is not the highest skill group I can reach. Once I learn about everything crucial in ML, my humble estimate is that Mythic ~400 points would probably be where I belong. And that's my next goal.
