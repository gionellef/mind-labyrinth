# League of Legends

I broke my Linux setup trying to get LoL to work. Tanked my hard drive and OS, all but a lesson in futility. Haha. The reason I went so far just to play the game was because my crush asked me to install it and play with her. That's all. That's why I went through all that trouble. 

Since I essentially destroyed my laptop, I had to reinstall an Operating System, but I had no flash drive nor another pc I could download an OS from, so I ordered a flash drive with Windows 10 from Lazada. 

Waited approximately 5 days, because the lockdown delayed all deliveries significantly - and also because it ships from Ilo-ilo - for the flash drive to arrive.

On the 6th day I finally got to play.

Wanting to learn the game right, I read tutorials, caught up on the meta, memorized several champions, and played with the intent to soak up game knowledge ---- all day.

The next day, feeling confident that I could at least not feed in unranked matches, I messaged her.

To which she didn't reply \(for the first time\), thus, prompting me to stalk her for a bit.

I found a guy.... a 'baby', just very recently. LoL indeed.



I lost interest.
