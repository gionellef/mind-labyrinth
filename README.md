# Introduction

Hi there, my name is Gionelle F. Tribiana. A Software Developer turned DevOps Engineer trying to survive in this harsh IT world.

I got the inspiration to create my own personal wiki from [Nikita Voloboev](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/), the man currently with the largest personal wiki open to the public. He also does some pretty cool stuff I found really interesting.
