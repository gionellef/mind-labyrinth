# DevOps

Since I made the specialty field switch from C++ R&D  to DevOps Engineering, I have had to learn A TON of things. Most of which are big picture stuff that I previously did not have to worry about. Here, the problems have bigger scope and you're potentially breaking / fixing something that will affect several projects or customers.

It's very exciting but there's little to no algorithmic code writing that I've grown to love over the past few years. Automation is the bread and butter, but making sure everything's running smoothly for devs to churn out as many features as possible is the philosophy.
