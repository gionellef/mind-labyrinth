# The Cafe Terrace on the Place du Forum

![&#x201C;Oh but how can there be dark, without a trace of black? Is it a genius&#x2019; work, or of by some extreme luck?&quot;](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%281%29.png)

#### There are many valuable Van Gogh artworks, but this one is my favorite.

It's the normality of this scene gives it such powerful relatability. It's almost like someone walking down the street at night sees an every night situation, paints it, inadvertently making it infinitely more beautiful - relatable. Although the intention was just to immortalize the scenery, it elicits powerful nostalgia from people who've been there, and to us who romanticize the idea of being there.



One extraordinary night  
A cloudless sky in sight  
Where the stars, without the moon,  
Are the only sources of light  
  
  
A scenic contrast of dark and light  
Makes stars appear so bright  
Obliterating the word "black"  
In a supposed picture of night  
  
  
People coming and people going  
From the murk, and then staying  
In a caf√© - to be restless,  
At a time we should be resting



People leaving and disappearing,  
After hours of coffee drinking,  
       Of endless story sharing,  
To finally go home smiling.
