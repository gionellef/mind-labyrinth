# Anatomy of the Heart





_**And she had a heart!**_

_**Who thought, who knew?**_

_**Somebody stole it, tore it apart,**_

_**Now she's broken,**_

_**Just a sad piece of art.**_

_\*\*\*\*_

_**Scuro - Chiaro. Dark and Light.**_

_**Bad and Good. Male - Female.**_

_**Women were created by the first night.**_

_**When God said, "Let there be light!"**_
