# a playlist for faUsTiNo to listen

#### Plastic Love  by Mariya Takeuchi

It does sound like "Is It The Answer" - I believe because of the chord progression. Although it's too long for my attention span, i rate 8/10. XD

#### 街のドルフィン \(Dolphin in Town\) - Kingo Hamada

Reminds me of memories I didn't know I had, old school anime, and the 80's.... also a song -Everybody Wants to Rule the World by Tears for Fears.  HAGSAgHAHA I reaaally really like this one. Makes me wanna suggest Rough Skies by FFW or something by Tom's Story because of the guitar bends and the keyboard's sound.

#### Angèle - Eels x Richard Cocciante \| A Take Away Show

Damn she's so prettyyyyyy and sings while playing piano!!!! :&lt; Haha tapos pinakinggan ko agad kasunod yung I Kissed a Girl cover niya HAHAHA
