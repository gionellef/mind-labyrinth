# The reason I play the piano

Looking back to when I first started learning the piano \(at 6 years old\), I had home teachers who weren't very good. I outpaced my first teacher in a year and he had nothing else to teach. My second teacher got obsessed with teaching me pop music arrangements she created, which I honestly didn't enjoy. At that point, I started HATING the instrument.
